# Paper-Trading-Simulation
This Python program creates a simple paper trading simulation for beginner traders using the Alpha Vintage API. The PaperTrader class within the program allows users to buy and sell stocks based on randomly generated prices which try to simulate the market. Additionally, the program allows the user to visualize their portfolio and balance to view profits or losses.

## Features
**Buy and Sell:** Users enter stock symbols to buy or sell certain stocks at a certain price and quantity.
**Portfolio Display:** Users can view their portfolio of all the different stocks purchased along with the number of shares in that stock.
**Stock Symbols Validation:** Using the Alpha Vintage API, a list of stock symbols are obtained for the user to choose from.
**User Interface:** *Currently, the program allows the user to buy, sell, view portfolio or quit the program. Future changes could allow the program to have a proper user interface in the form of a webpage.
